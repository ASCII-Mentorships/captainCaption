# Introduction


This project is a fusion of a chrome plugin and a Deep Learning model that can be used to annotate accurate captions for scientific lectures.

# Goal

- The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used to annotate captions for scientific lectures.
- The tool should be able to recognize the captions and annotate them correctly, based on the scientific terms unlike current captioning tools which are prone to errors with certain terms.

# Description

The tool must be able to tackle the following problems:
- [ ] Recognize the captions and annotate them correctly.
- [ ] Take in the scientific terms in the form of a pdf or a text document.
- [ ] Output the annotated captions in a text file.


# Technologies

- Javascript for the chrome extension.
- Python for the deep learning model.
[More details about the actual libraries and tools in python can be decided based on the inputs of the students]

# Tentative Timeline

We plan to work for around 12-15 weeks.

We will be working on the following milestones:

- [ ] Week 1: Research and analysis of the problem.
- [ ] Weeks 2-3: Scouting datasets and skeleton development of the chrome extension.
- [ ] Weeks 4-5: Data preprocessing, and learning how to integrate the deep learning model with the extension using Chrome APIs.
- [ ] Weeks 6-8: Developing the model and fine-tuning it, and continuing work on the extension.
- [ ] Weeks 9-11: Individual development of modules and unit testing.
- [ ] Weeks 12-14: Integration testing and bug-fixing.
- [ ] Week 15: Demo readiness.
